The colorization neural network model has four components. The network has an encoder and a decoder, with a fusion layer between them. In parallel to the encoder, the input images also run through the Inception ResNet v2(A neural network trained on 1M+ images). The classification layer is extracted & merged with the output from the encoder. By transferring the learning from the classifier to the coloring network, the network can get a sense of whatâ€™s in the picture. Thus, enabling the network to match an object representation with a coloring scheme.
